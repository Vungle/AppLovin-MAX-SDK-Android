   git@github.com:Vungle/Vungle-TestApp-AppLovin-MAX-SDK-Android.git

2. Add run permissions to these scripts:
   `chmod +x scripts/cleanForTesting.sh` This script adds the necessary gradle files to build and compile the adapter

`chmod +x scripts/cleanForPublish.sh` This script removes gradle files added for local dev

3. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` This will automatically set it to master

4. Run `scripts/cleanForTesting.sh`

5. Check whether `app`„ÄÅ`AppLovin-MAX-SDK-Android` on the correct branch

6. Open `app` project on AndroidStudio

7. Checkout develop for `AppLovin-MAX-SDK-Android` and `Vungle-TestApp-AppLovin-MAX-SDK-Android`

<h2>Keeping Develop and Master Branch Up to Date:</h2>

1.`master` branch is to track upstream : `https://github.com/AppLovin/AppLovin-MAX-SDK-Android` and should not have any code merged into it.

2. Add `https://github.com/AppLovin/AppLovin-MAX-SDK-Android` and pull regularly upstream master into origin master to keep it up to date.
3. Then pull master into develop

<h2>How to build adapter library</h2>

1. cd to `Vungle-TestApp-AppLovin-MAX-SDK-Android/AppLovin-MAX-SDK-Android/Vungle`
2. run `gradle build`
3. cd to `AppLovin-MAX-SDK-Android/Vungle/build/outputs/aar`
4. Inside there should be a Vungle-debug.aar and Vungle-release.aar

<h2>How to build test app for QA</h2>

2. Run the workflow `AppCenter-QA-Release`
   Releases can be found: https://appcenter.ms/orgs/Linda-Pham-Organization/apps/Android-Max-Mediation-Test-App/

<h2>Adapter release check list</h2>

1. After passing QA we'll need to run `scripts/cleanForPublish.sh` and update the PR to revert the gradle files in the Vungle directory.
2. Commit and push changes to branch.
